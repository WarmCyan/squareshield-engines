		<tr><th>Class/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		<tr class='row1'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='physics.html'> Physics</a></code></td>
			<td>Representation/collection of all physical properties that an object can have. NOTE: EVERY OBJECT THAT GETS EVALUATED BY THE PHYSICS ENGINE MUST CONTAIN AN INSTANCE OF THIS CLASS. Also note an important feature of this physics engine: It is entirely layer based, which means if you want an object to collide with something else, they both have to exist on a common layer. (See the layers property below for more information.)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row2'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='physicsengine.html'> PhysicsEngine</a></code></td>
			<td>The engine itself, this class contains all the engine constants and objects, and it takes care of handling all calculations, detecting and resolving collisions, and updating the positions of the objects. This class will also check for global functions as a pseudo "event system." Look in the functions section for more information.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row1'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='collisionmanifold.html'> CollisionManifold</a></code></td>
			<td>This is a class that stores and computes information about a collision between two objects. Every time the <a href='physicsengine.html'>PhysicsEngine</a> detects a collision, it creates an instance of this class and stores it in an array of collisions. When it resolves collisions, it goes through that list and uses the information stored in these instances.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row2'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='testobject.html'> TestObject</a></code></td>
			<td>NOTE: NOT A PART OF THE ACTUAL PHYSICS ENGINE. This is an example class that demonstrates how to integrate the physics engine with a 'game object'. This class should NOT be included in a final product involving the physics engine! It serves as an example only!</td>
