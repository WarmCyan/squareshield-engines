0.2.6 beta - 
============================================
- Removed extra debugging log function call

0.2.5 beta - 3 builds (6/21/2015)
============================================
- Tested engine

0.2.4 beta - 20 builds (6/21/2015)
============================================
- Fixed kinetic energy transfer procedure (velocities are combined based on collision direction BEFORE calculating kinetic energy)
- Fixed physics engine's entities access (now based on functions)
- Finished documentation

0.2.3 beta - 27 builds (6/18/2015)
============================================
- Began creating documentation for the code
- Started cleaning up code
- Testing, testing, testing
- Added entity managing functions to physics engine
- Added internal id system to physics and engine

0.2.2 beta - 44 builds (6/17/2015)
============================================
- Implemented a simple event based system to the engine (interface can implement events that the engine will call if found)
- Implemented basic kinetic energy and damage transfer in the interface
- Fixed damage transfer ratios (now averages kinetic energy)
