<h2>SquareShield Engines 0.2.5 BETA Class Index</h2>
	<table class='dataTable'>
		<tr><th>Class/Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		<tr class='row1'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='physics.html'> Physics</a></code></td>
			<td>Representation/collection of all physical properties that an object can have. NOTE: EVERY OBJECT THAT GETS EVALUATED BY THE PHYSICS ENGINE MUST CONTAIN AN INSTANCE OF THIS CLASS. Also note an important feature of this physics engine: It is entirely layer based, which means if you want an object to collide with something else, they both have to exist on a common layer. (See the layers property below for more information.)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row2'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='physicsengine.html'> PhysicsEngine</a></code></td>
			<td>The engine itself, this class contains all the engine constants and objects, and it takes care of handling all calculations, detecting and resolving collisions, and updating the positions of the objects. This class will also check for global functions as a pseudo "event system." Look in the functions section for more information.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row1'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='collisionmanifold.html'> CollisionManifold</a></code></td>
			<td>This is a class that stores and computes information about a collision between two objects. Every time the <a href='physicsengine.html'>PhysicsEngine</a> detects a collision, it creates an instance of this class and stores it in an array of collisions. When it resolves collisions, it goes through that list and uses the information stored in these instances.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row2'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='symbol.html'> Symbol</a></code></td>
			<td>Small class used for creating font alphabets, associating a single character with a block binary matrix. For the font engine to work, you need to create an array of these symbols named "alphabet".</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row1'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='text.html'> Text</a></code></td>
			<td>This class is a collection of <a href='textchar.html'>TextChar</a> objects and rendering properties. It can be thought of as representing a string, when you want text to be rendered in your canvas, most of the information needs to go into an instance of this class. (NOTE: This engine requires a global "alphabet" array that contains symbols for any characters you want the ability to render.) Keep in mind that fonts are displayed by rendering out small blocks in the shapes of letters (based on matricies that you define.)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row2'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='textchar.html'> TextChar</a></code></td>
			<td>Class for a single character inside of a text object. An instance of this class holds positioning, rendering, and animation information for an individual character.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class='row1'>
			<td class='return_modifier_box'><code><span class='keyword'>class</span> <a href='animation.html'> Animation</a></code></td>
			<td>Generic animation class that can handle linear interpolation of keyframes. It works by taking in a certain type of data, (hex-color, number, or a matrix [array of arrays]) and any number of keyframes for that data. Then, whenever the update function is called, it calculates the current set of data based on linear interpolation for the current time between surrounding keyframes. Although this comes packaged with the engine specifically for text animations, THIS CLASS CAN BE USED GENERICALLY TO LINEARLY ANIMATE ANY PROPERTY that can be defined as a hex-color, number, or matrix.</td>
