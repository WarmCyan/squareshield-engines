things animation has:




time start
length [time]
update function (dt)
list of keyframes holding various data
type of animation [to designate WHAT, or what variable is being animated]



NOTE: needs to be function in the animation that returns CURRENT matrix/frame 
(up to the class that contains animation to HANDLE that data)


DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY A TEXT ANIMATION, this process should work for any type of animation, since it's the
container class that actually HANDLES information.
